# ScrapyScrapson:
a discord bot to create saveable chat log text and html files by Jaye :).
Format to scrape messages is !Scrape [Category/Channel] "[Source Channel/Category]" [Destination Channel] [txt/html].
As categories can have spaces you can place category in quotation marks to preserve whitespace.
HTML code was entirely swiped from Alexey Golub's Discord Exporter: https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter .
Token.txt not provided, if you want to run this bot yourself, go to the discord developer portal, create a bot app and save the token in a txt file called Token.txt.
Feel free to use/modify this code as long as it's not for malicious purposes!
