# ScrapyScrapson \n
a discord bot to create saveable chat log text and html files by Jaye :)\n
Format to scrape messages is !Scrape [Category/Channel] "[Source Channel/Category]" [Destination Channel] [txt/html] \n
As categories can have spaces you can place category in quotation marks to preserve whitespace. \n
HTML code was entirely swiped from Alexey Golub's Discord Exporter: https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter \n
Token.txt no provided, if you want to run this bot yourself, go to the discord developer portal, create a bot app and save the token in a txt file called Token.txt. \n
Feel free to use/modify this code as long as it's not for malicious purposes! \n
